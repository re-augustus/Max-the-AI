ok hello lmao as u prolly know this is an "ai" i made lol
dont ask why tho
cuz idk either

---------------------------------------------------------------------

ai first of all, if u download it your browser would prolly say sumn like 'this file isnt commonly downloaded it and is prolly a virus'. just so yk, this isnt a virus lmao, and it says it isnt commonly downloaded cuz i just put it online lmao so ofc no one has downloaded it yet.

but anyways using it is quite simple

first of all download the .rar file and unzip its contents
then open the folder and click on the 'Max' shortcut and it should launch

btw it only works on Windows (cuz its an exe lmao) but its only been tested on Win10 (cuz thats my system lmao)

if u saw the vid then yk it has 3 options:
- time
- date
- weather

if u type sumn wrong dw it'll ask u to retype 

if you want it to stop just type 'die' or close the app. better yet, delete it.


disclaimer: i am not to be held accountable for whatever potential problems this application causes on your system; use at your own risk loooool
